      I have a passion for product development and marketing with experience in the banking, real estate and tech industries. As a Product Manager at Citigroup Japan, I helped create and market unsecured loan products and loyalty programs. At Shinsei Bank, I developed the bank’s first signature Visa credit card. More recently at DevLeague, I developed, managed and taught the DevLeague (Javascript) Prep class, which accounted for over 40% of the company’s top line revenue.
